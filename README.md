# XAIplayground

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a web-based  user friendly AI playground application where it is able to interact playfully with the underlying data, models and explainability concepts and receive immediate response about the impact of their choices. The central focus is to develop more traceability, transparancy and trust by actively including the end user in the decision making process of the machine learning models and visualize whole process. This is done by following the key concepts: 

## Features
1. **Synthesize Data**: Users can playfully create and change the data by adjusting initialization parameters like the trend, seasonality, amplitude, noise and other things of a time series
2. **Explore Data**: Users can look at the data and reveive the most meaningful insights through numerical and visual features (mean, variance, autocorelation, data distribution, sophisticated visualizations)
3. **model selection**: Users can choose between different models which are trained by the customized data sets
4. **explainability approach**: Users receive information about the decision making process of the current model through various visualizations and explainability concepts like shap, lime etc.
5. **Comparison**: Users can playfully compare two datasets and/or models side by side in order to easiely recognize differences based on theirs choices.
